# Board for reading 10 thermistors, and sending the output on USB

## Board Details:

This board should contain the following:
-  Slot for the microcontroller, nominally a Seeeduino XIAO or similar, with at least 10 12bit ADCs
-  Headers for connecting 10 leads to thermistors, so 20 pins/sockets
-  10 reference resistors, one for each thermistor

## Board Utility:

This board is useful for general bake monitoring of large systems, or anything else that requires measuring multiple thermistors. 

The CUEBIT uses such a board for monitoring external system temperatures, presently using 10 sensors around the source and beamline.

## Things to buy for Project:

-  Microcontroller, costs ~$5-10, cheaper from manufacturer, but also on Amazon
-  header slots for Microcontroller, cheap, 100s for few $
-  Board printing, often also ~$10, varies based on quality
-  10 thermistors, can get $50 for $7 on Amazon
-  10 reference resistors, ~$10-20 for good stability
-  20 pins/socket, cheap, 100s for a few $, or can go fancier
-  High temperature cable/wire for hookups, prices vary, but usually ~$0.5-1 / ft
