# Revival of the MAT Chamber

The MAT chamber was completely dissasembled for parts, most of which are presently in room 111. These can be recovered and the MAT chamber could be re-assembled.

## General assembly plan

-  Re-design for faster pumping, possibly with a moveable shutter for limiting conductance to the pump when pumping on plastics?
-  Design with ports for installing and testing various devices such as ion sources and electron guns
